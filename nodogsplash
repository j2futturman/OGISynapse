  #
    authenticated-users
    preauthenticated-users
  # users-to-router
  # trusted-users
  # trusted-users-to-router
  #
  # For each of these, an EmptyRuleSetPolicy can be specified.
  # An EmptyRuleSet policy applies to a FirewallRuleSet if the
  # FirewallRuleSet is missing from this configuration file,
  # or if it exists but contains no FirewallRules.
  #
  # The possible values of an EmptyRuleSetPolicy are:
  # allow -- packets are accepted
  # block -- packets are rejected
  # passthrough -- packets are passed through to pre-existing firewall rules
  #
  # Default EmptyRuleSetPolicies are set as follows:
  # EmptyRuleSetPolicy authenticated-users passthrough
  # EmptyRuleSetPolicy preauthenticated-users block
  # EmptyRuleSetPolicy users-to-router block
  # EmptyRuleSetPolicy trusted-users allow
  # EmptyRuleSetPolicy trusted-users-to-router allow

  # By setting this parameter, you can specify a range of IP addresses
  # on the GatewayInterface that will be responded to and managed by
  # Nodogsplash. Addresses outside this range do not have their packets
  # touched by Nodogsplash at all.
  # Defaults to 0.0.0.0/0, that is, all addresses.
