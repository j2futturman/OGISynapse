# OGI-Synapse
<a href="http://ogisynapse.com"><strong>OGI Synapse</strong></a> is an "off-the-grid-internet" concept using wireless mesh-network and self sustainable power source. We are an experimental open group that build upon the the Commotion and the Serval Project.

We join the community of wireless mesh networking to further explore, discover and contribute ideas.

We aim to come up with an "Off-the-Grid-Internet"solution.  An alternative method of connectivity during the aftermath of a major calamity that had resulted to disruption of electricity, communications and internet services.

Connecting the unconnected and to have "Connectivity off-the-grid"  that is our goal at OGIsynapse .
